# 2022 Mingleton vanilla Minecraft server
This is the central location to find information, rules and updates about the Mingleton vanilla Minecraft server. This repository will eventually be superceded by an official website, but for now that does not exist.

## Links
All links, IP addresses, etc. can be found within the Miney Crafters section of the Mingleton server. This can be distributed privately, but public distribution is not allowed.

## Rules
- No hate speech, racism, sexism, etc. etc. in the chat or towards other players.
- No griefing of property or people. Pranks are allowed, but they must be harmless, or be prepared to help the people affected recover to an equivalent or better standard.
- No cheating (flying, xrays, etc.)
- Avoid constructing large, power-consuming farms or projects without prior approval from one of the Discord server moderators. The server is powerful, but not infinitely so, and we need to be mindful that we share this server with our friends over at STiBaRC :)
- Client-side mods and improvements are allowed, so long as they do not attempt to subvert the above rules

## Inviting people
Anybody in the Mingleton Discord server is more than welcome to invite anybody to the Minecraft server, however keep the following things in mind when inviting them:
- Understand our playing style and know that we expect any new participants and guests on the server to adhere to this (i.e. ensure they won't go on a chaotic rampage)
- Encourage them to familiarise themselves with this document so they understand what we expect when they play
- Encourage them to join the Mingleton Discord as that will be *the* place to receive updates about the state of the server. You will need to provide them the invite link (it can be found at the bottom of `#important-all`) as we no longer share this link publicly
- If they would like to invite their friends (friends-of-friends), they should join the Discord server so we can introduce some level of accountability if they don't follow these rules

## Server modifications
Currently, we have a number of notable and minor tweaks on the server to improve quality-of-life slightly. These improvements don't require any additional installation on your behalf, but are worth keeping in mind.

### Teleportation
- **Spawn:** Using `/trigger spawn` - instantly teleport you to the spawn garden
- **Homes:**
  - `/trigger sethome` - create a home at your current location (will override a previously set home)
  - `/trigger home` - instantly teleport to your home location (if it is set)
  - `/trigger delhome` - deletes your home teleportation location
  
### Optional resource pack
Upon first joining the server, you will be asked if you would like to install an optional resource pack. We would recommend this for anybody using the vanilla/default Minecraft textures as this offers some nice improvements, however **avoid this if you have your own resource pack; it will ruin your experience**

### Crafting tweaks
These are changes/improvements to crafting:
- **Straight to shapeless** - Allows alternative 2x2 crafting of small items like Shulker boxes & bread
- **Universal dyeing** - Any dyeable blocks can be used to craft others
- **More bricks** - Crafting bricks will provide 4 blocks, instead of the usual 1
- **Craftable name tags** - Name tags can be crafted (see your recipe book in-game)

### Other misc tweaks
- **Fast leaf decay** - Leaves decay quickly once a tree is cut down
- **AFK display** - Inactive users are greyed-out on the user menu (<kbd>TAB</kbd>)
- **Multiplayer sleep** - 50% of the overworld's population needs to sleep to skip the night
- **More mob heads** - Mobs have a chance of dropping their head upon death
- **Silence mobs** - Naming a mob "silence me" will cause it to no longer make noise
- **Name colours** - Set your name to a different colour in chat
- **Kill empty boats** - [admin only] - Helps us remove empty boats
- **Unlock all recipes** - Instantly unlocks all crafting recipes upon first joining the server
